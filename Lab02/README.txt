CS 262 - Lab 1
This lab is based on https://github.com/kvlinden-courses/cs262-code/blob/master/lab01/myNewProject/App.js

hacks that I had to make:
Adding a button and making that button functional for the lab

Answers to the lab questions:

1. The component in this application is called "clickHandler". When the button is pushed it calls clickHandler to do all the stuff.
2. One Prop is age and one state is year
3.Curly braces are used to group elements of code into one unit. For example a function has all of its elements inside {}. They are also used to declare variables inside of a text tag
4. ClickHandler is an anonymous function as it does not accept arguments
5. No, It uses XML not HTML
